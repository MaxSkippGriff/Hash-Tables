## Two Hash Tables

Two hash tables, including a cuckoo hash.

A cuckoo hash table works as follows.

If both indexes in the table are occupied, you kick one index away from its 'nest', just like the world's most evil bird, the cuckoo.

This helps resolve the issue of collisions in hash tables and puts cuckoos to good - and ethical - use.
